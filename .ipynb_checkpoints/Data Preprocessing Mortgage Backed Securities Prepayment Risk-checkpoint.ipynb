Disclosure indicates whether a broker or correspondent, as those terms are defined below, originated or was involved in the origination or the mortgage. If a Third-Party Origination is applicable, but the Seller does not specify Broker or Correspondent, the disclosure will indicate “TPO Not Specified.” If a Broker, Correspondent or Third Party Origination disclosure is not applicable, the mortgage loan will be designated as Retail, as defined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Broker is a person or entity that specializes in loan originations, receiving a commission (from a Correspondent or other lender) to match Borrowers and lenders. The Broker performs some or most of the loan processing functions, such as taking loan applications, or ordering credit reports, appraisals and title reports. Typically, the Broker does not underwrite or service the mortgage loan and generally does not use its own funds for closing; however, if the Broker funded a mortgage loan on a lender’s behalf, such a mortgage loan is considered a “Broker” third party origination mortgage loan. The mortgage loan is generally closed in the name of the lender who commissioned the Broker’s services. \n",
    "• Correspondent is an entity that typically sells the Mortgages it originates to other lenders, which are not Affiliates of that entity, under a specific commitment or as part of an ongoing relationship. The Correspondent performs some or all the loan processing functions, such as taking the loan application, ordering credit reports, appraisals, and title reports, and verifying the Borrower’s income and employment. The Correspondent may or may not have delegated underwriting and typically funds the mortgage loans at settlement. The mortgage loan is closed in the Correspondent’s name and the Correspondent may or may not service the mortgage loan. The Correspondent may use a Broker to perform some of the processing functions or even to fund the loan on its behalf; under such circumstances, the mortgage loan is considered a “Broker” third party origination mortgage loan, rather than a “Correspondent” third party origination mortgage loan. \n",
    "• Retail Mortgage is a mortgage loan that is originated, underwritten and funded by a lender or its Affiliates. The mortgage loan is closed in the name of the lender or its Affiliate and if it is sold to Freddie Mac, it is sold by the lender or its Affiliate that originated it. A mortgage loan that a Broker or Correspondent completely or partially originated, processed, underwrote, packaged, funded or closed is not considered a Retail mortgage loan. \n",

Paying off unsecured liens or construction costs paid by the Borrower outside of the secured interim construction financing is considered cash out to the Borrower, if greater than $2,000 or 2% of the loan amount. This disclosure is subject to various special exceptions used by Sellers to determine whether a mortgage loan is a No Cash-out Refinance mortgage loan.
